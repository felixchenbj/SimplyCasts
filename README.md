## To build the project
I tried to use CocoaPods to manage the libraries I used in this project. But it's my first time using it. I hope I did it right.

Before you start, make sure that you have installed the CocoaPods.
After clone or download the source code, you need do the following steps to build it:
- open the Terminal
- go to the folder of the project
- run command 'pod install'
- open the workspace file 'SimplyCasts.xcworkspace'
